# Unofficial .deb packaging for Flink

[![Latest Version @ Cloudsmith](https://api-prd.cloudsmith.io/v1/badges/version/wand/streamevmon/deb/flink-scala2.12/latest/a=all;d=any-distro%252Fany-version;t=binary/?render=true&badge_token=gAAAAABgUTGBIk0C_gkv6qGmn7kyAZPX-8Qy-rrUpWNisGTqhbJnj28CBt9OV4uO4wlRUqYm7MfuGgdgGsVKEityI_lVwSRRaAGmNbvANQ8ftfQCqeez0is%3D)](https://cloudsmith.io/~wand/repos/streamevmon/packages/detail/deb/flink-scala2.12/latest/a=all;d=any-distro%252Fany-version;t=binary/)

This repository packages the official releases of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) into the .deb format, and pushes the result to Cloudsmith. This is used as a dependency for [streamevmon](https://github.com/wanduow/streamevmon), though may be useful for other applications.

To release a new version, just add an entry to the [changelog](debian/changelog). An example can be found at commit [`0f785f`](https://github.com/danoost/flink-deb/commit/0f785f970e63c52c31577fd23c0e2c49b33dc02a)

This is not an official Apache repository, and no endorsement or acknowledgement is claimed.
